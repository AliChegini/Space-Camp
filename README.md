Raw Project Description:

Your mission, is to build an iOS app in Swift using the the NASA API. 
You need to implement two required features. We expect you to use different skills in different ways and encourage you to go above and beyond the requirements stated in terms of usage of APIs and iOS capabilities. 
This is the opportunity to make a really nice portfolio piece, and we hope you make it your own!  We hope you will get creative and base your layouts and design on the particular functionalities of your app.

The App must make use of UICollectionViews, ScrollViews, Animation, Unit Testing, Error Handling and Asynchronous networking.
