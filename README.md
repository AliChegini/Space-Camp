Project Description:

Your project, is to build an iOS app in Swift using the the NASA API. 
You need to implement two required features. We expect you to use different skills in different ways and encourage you to go above and beyond the requirements stated in terms of usage of APIs and iOS capabilities. 

This is the opportunity to make a really nice portfolio piece, and we hope you make it your own!  We hope you will get creative and base your layouts and design on the particular functionalities of your app.

The App must make use of UICollectionViews, ScrollViews, Animation, Unit Testing, Error Handling and Asynchronous networking.


Rover Postcard Maker: Access the Mars Rover Imagery API and display a selected, filtered, or randomized image from the Mars Rover. You should also build functionalities such that a user can add text over the image and then flatten the new image and send through an email address.


Astronomy Picture of the Day: Build a tool to access the APOD API and display a photo of the day, provide a functionality that user can read about the picture and Zoom In.
